# General Development and Coding Document

This guide outlines the best practice and coding conventions.

## Introduction

Here are some of the documents from where we derived our styling guide. If something isn't mentioned here, it's probably covered in great detail in one of these:

* [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* [Google Javascript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
* [Magento Official Coding Standards](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/coding-standards/bk-coding-standards.html)
